Looks
=====

In this section we focus on how the graphical elements (sprites) look and 
 how you can modify their look.

Sprites
-------

Sprites are the graphical objects which you place into the stage.

They have a 

- name (Scratchy)
- position (x=-171, y=-110)
- visbility (show)
- size (120%)
- direction (90Â°)

Backdrops
---------

Backdrops are like sprites, but they are fix in size and cannot be repositioned.

As bitmaps they have the size 360 x 480 pixels.
However in the editor there is twice the pixel density.
In full-screen mode you can see the pixels.
